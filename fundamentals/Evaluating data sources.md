### Evaluating data sources- Drill
### In each of the scenarios, find possible shortcomings of the theoretical or actual data sources to answer the given question. What could be done to either adjust the analysis or reframe the question so that you can answer it accurately?

### Data Source: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?
Collecting data on the day before Christmas is going to distort the results since a lot of people are on holiday during that time. Instead you could limit the conclusion of you findings by asking "What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam over Christmas?", or you could collect data on different days that aren't close to a holiday. 

### Data Source: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?
The data will be highly unusual due to it being the day after the 9/11 attacks which disproportionately affected New York compared to other cities. To improve, you could find data from a different day before 9/11 or find data on other cities that weren't as affected  as New York. 

### Data Source: Armenian Pub Survey. Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?
Since the data was collected from students it can't be applied to all Armenians. Limiting the conclusions to students only would improve it's accuracy.
