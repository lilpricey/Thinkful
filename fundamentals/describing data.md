## Describing Data 3/29/18

### 1
Greg was 14, Marcia was 12, Peter was 11, Jan was 10, Bobby was 8, and Cindy was 6 when they started playing the Brady kids on The Brady Bunch. Cousin Oliver was 8 years old when he joined the show. What are the mean, median, and mode of the kids' ages when they first appeared on the show? What are the variance, standard deviation, and standard error?

14, 12, 11, 10, 8, 8, 6 
n = 7
 mean = 9.86
 median = 10
 mode = 8
 
 v = sum((x - mean) ** 2) / (n - 1)
 17.14, 4.58, 1.3, .02, 3.46, 3.46, 14.9
 44.86 / 7 
 
 variance = 6.41
 std = 2.53
 
 2.53 / 2.65
 
 se = .95
 
### 2
Using these estimates, if you had to choose only one estimate of central tendency and one estimate of variance to describe the data, which would you pick and why?
 
 mean and standard deviation. The mean is very close to the median, but doesn't ignore the 8 that slightly pulls it down.
 
 ### 3
 Next, Cindy has a birthday. Update your estimates- what changed, and what didn't?
