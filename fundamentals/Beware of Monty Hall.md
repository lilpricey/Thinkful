You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?

Disclosure: I've seen this problem on Khan Academy 

The probability that you select the winning door on your first choice is 1/3.
The probabilty that it's one of the other two doors is 2/3.
After one of the duds is revealed there is still a 1/3 chance that your initial choice is right, 
and a 2/3 chance that it's the other door that hasn't been revealed.  

 Using Baye's rule:
 Given the new information, what is the probability of the three possible options:
 if you choose door A, and the host opens door B:
 If the prize is in door A, there is a 50% chance they would open door B.
 If the prize in door B, there is a 0% chance they would open door B.
 If the prize is in door C, there is a 100% chance they would open door B.
 So given that you choose A and they open door B, it is twice as likely to be in C than A.
