You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?

Disclosure: I've seen this problem on Khan Academy 

The probability that you select the winning door on your first choice is 1/3.
The probabilty that it's one of the other two doors is 2/3.
After one of the duds is revealed there is still a 1/3 chance that your initial choice is right, 
and a 2/3 chance that it's the other door that hasn't been revealed.
