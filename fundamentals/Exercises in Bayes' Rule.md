## Exercises in Bayes' Rule

A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, and 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers. Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. Calculate the probability that the test will:

### 1. Be positive
intuituon: .0049 + .0995 = 10.44%

### 2. Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
intuituon: 98%

### 3. Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
intuition: 90%

### 4. Misclassify the person
intuition: .0995 + .0001 = 9.96%
