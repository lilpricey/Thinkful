    "#### 1.       Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics.\n",
    "\n",
    "multivariable least squares regression, SVM regression, ridge regression.\n",

    "#### 2.       You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reduce the number of features by performing PCA or RFE, or you can use lasso regression.\n",

    "#### 3.       Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use Logistic regression with lasso regularization, gradient boosting classification and utilize the feature importance attribute, or RFE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.       Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use KNN classifier, random forest classifier, SVM classifier.\n",
