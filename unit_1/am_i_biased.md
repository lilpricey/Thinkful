# Am I Biased? 
### You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
Bathing suits are a seasonal item, so you would want to test them during the same time of year. 

### You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
They are probably visiting because they have anxiety, or mayby the clinic causes anxiety. This doesn't even sound like a study. 

### You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
What is the overall trend of website visits before the ad? This could be observer bias if they are responsible for the ad as they would want to prove it's successful. What other things occurred during that week? 

### You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
Who has joined the loyalty program? It should be a random mix of customers who are already repeat customers, as well as new customers. What type of product or service are you selling? Is it something that people won't need to buy more than once a week?
