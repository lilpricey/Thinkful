** Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

The control version would be not taking the supplement, while the treatmant version would be taking the supplement.
The sample would be people who have trouble sleeping, randomly divided into two groups. Give one group the supplement, and one group a placebo.
The hypothesis would be- I expect the supplement to help people sleep better.
You would then record any change in sleep time, before and after the supplement was given.
You would probably want to track the participants sleep for a period of time before giving them anything so you have a baseline.

** Will new uniforms help a gym's business?

The contol version would be not changing the uniform. The treatment would be changing the uniform.
The sample would be having one location try the new uniforms, and see if there is a change in signup rate for that location compared to the other locations. 
The hypothesis would be- I expect the new unifroms to increase membership signups.
You would then record all new membership signups by location and compare to past data.
If there was a measurable change in signups when the new uniforms were being worn, then you could be confident that they will help the business.

** Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?

The control will be the old homepage, and the treatment will be a new homepage.
When users visit the website they will be randomly directed to one of two sites.
The hypothesis would be- I expect the new webpage to increase sales.
You would then compare purchase rate between the two groups to see if there is a difference.
If the sales are higher for the new site then the hypothesis is correct.

** If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

The control will be not having 'please read' in the subject, while the treatment will have 'please read'.
People that you send emails to will randomly receive one of the two versions.
The hypothesis would be- I expect the emails that have 'please read' will be opened more often.
You would then compare the open rate between the two different versions of the email.
If more people are opening the emails with the 'please read', then the hypothesis is correct.
