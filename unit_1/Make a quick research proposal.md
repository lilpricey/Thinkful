> The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger", isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

### The Problem - How to increase recruitment?
The problem is that recruitment for the dark side is not as good as the Sith Lords hoped. One potential cause is that the slogan might not be very effective. If the slogan is part of the cause, then switching to a new slogan will increase recruitment.

### The proposed solution
##### Hypothesis: Switching to a new slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy”, will increase the rate of recruitment.

### The method of testing the solution
**Two Versions** - The control will be the current slogan, "Give In to Your Anger". The treatment will be the new slogan "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy”. 

**The Sample** - The sample will be 100 droids who will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The droids selected for the study should not have been previously recruited, and shouldn't have any prior affiliations. All aspects of the recruiting process will be exactly the same for the two groups, except one group will be exposed to the control slogan, and the other group will be exposed to the treatment slogan. The recruitment rate for the previous 6 months will be compared to the recruitment rate of the two groups during the study. 
**Outcome** - If the rate of recruitment has increased by at least 10% by the time the recruitment process is complete. Then the new slogan will be officially instated. If there is an increase in recruitment rate, but it is less than 10%, then the study will be repeated with a larger sample size. If there is no increase in recruitment, the slogan will remain as is. 
**Other measured variables** -Other variables that will be collected is how long it takes for a recruit to commit or not, and whether or not they join The Force after the recruitment process is over.
